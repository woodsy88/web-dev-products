           <h2 class="blogPageSubHeader"> Why People Die on Black Friday</h2> 
  <p class="para blogBodyFont">While injuries and deaths on Black Friday have decreased the last two years, we can now look back on this consumer insanity and start to ask, why did this even happen?  Why does a day where everything from - toasters to TVs – guitars to sitars – and bongs to thongs - are 50% off result in stampedes, fist fights, and unnecessary deaths?  The answer is pretty apocalyptical, perceived scarcity.
</p>
           
           
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">In times of scarcity – where resources and items necessary for survival are believed to be low – the back of your mind will start to realize that you might need to use your brawn instead of your brain to get what you want.  While this kind of thought process might make more sense when imagining the resource allocation chaos of a Zombie Apocalypse or Trump Presidency, what happens in the minds of consumers during Black Friday is not that far off.

</p>
               <p class="para blogBodyFont">Just like monkeys fighting over the last banana to take home to their little baby monkeys, people have evolved in a similar way.  Our cavemen ancestors sometimes had to physically fight for food and shelter when there wasn't always enough.  The strongest prevailed, engaged in cavemen sex (regular sex…but in a cave), and then had cavebabies.  Each generation passed on various traits necessary for survival, such as opposable thumbs and walking upright.  But also, just in case, these aggressive psychological tendencies to prevail in times of scarcity were passed on as well.  Just waiting to be turned on in times of need, when resources appear low, and competition is tough. 

</p>
           
                          <p class="para blogBodyFont">For many fortunate people, this aggressive switch is rarely or has never been turned on.  Our society has managed to figure out a way to keep grocery store shelves stocked and keep prices to an affordable level.  Thanks Adam Smith!  However, every so often you might be encountered with a situation where your mind reverts back to full caveman and decides to uncontrollably flip that switch.  Black Friday is just such an occasion.

</p>
                         <p class="para blogBodyFont">Some recent research from Kirk Kristofferson (Arizona State University) points out that Black Friday has conditions that are prime for triggering these remnants of cavemendom (my word, not his).  He finds that Ads promoting scarcity – like those that pop up before Black Friday, such as “One Day Only!!!”, “Limited Quantity!!!”, “While Supplies Last!!!” - can trigger a perceived competitive threat.  A perceived competitive threat that another caveman is going to get the last banana and go home to your cave!  Sit on your cave sofa!  Drink your cave beer!  And have sex with your sexy cave wife!!


</p>
           
           <p class="para blogBodyFont">Just like our ancestors, this perceived competitive threat primes us for battle.  Our bodies get ready by producing more testosterone (the “I don't take guff from nobody!” hormone) and when those Bed, Bath, and Beyond store doors open at midnight of Black Friday, conditions are perfect for fisticuffs.  Through his research, Kirk finds that this perceived competitive threat (primed by scarcity advertising) increases testosterone and increases aggressive behaviours.  They demonstrate this across numerous studies where participants are exposed to an advertisement with a scarcity (e.g., “Only 3 Available!”) or non-scarcity (e.g., “3,000+ Available”) message, and then are later asked to engage in an activity that requires some aggression (e.g., playing a first-person shooter video game).  The results find that those exposed to the scarcity advertisement perceive a higher competitive threat, produce more testosterone, and then exhibit more aggression in their subsequent activity (e.g., they shoot more bullets in their game) than those exposed to the non-scarcity advertisement.



</p>
           
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">As consumers, we are not aware of our caveman past and the impact it can have on our minds and behaviours.  And what this research tells us, is that it can have such an impact that people lose their lives.  However, we watch these insane behaviours from shaky first-person phone camera video posted to the internet and think that these people are batshit crazy.  Fighting over the last Pikachu Hoodie or trampling the 60-year-old Wal-Mart greeter.  But on a scale from “Lazy Sunday” to full “Zombie Meltdown,” the hysteria and Ads behind Black Friday pushes us up this scale just a little bit.  For some people, this can be just enough to shove a pregnant woman, steal candy from a baby, or sucker punch a senior citizen.  From the safety of our screens it is easy to judge, but we are all slaves to our evolution.




</p>
           
           <p class="para blogBodyFont">So this Christmas, when you might be pinching your pocket book.  Trying to get all the things for little Timmy and still have enough left over to eat.  For your own safety, please shop online.  But if you find yourself in the trenches of Target or the bunkers of Best-Buy, remember you are not an ape and there will be more bananas tomorrow.  So take cover, and take out your phone.
