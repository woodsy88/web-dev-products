           <h2 class="blogPageSubHeader"> How the order in which candidates are listed on the ballot can sway voter choice</h2> 
  <p class="para blogBodyFont">One thing that is talked about a lot in tight elections, is the undecided.  Candidates focus their efforts on targeting their policies, ads, and sound bites to these undecided to get their vote.  But what else can sway the unswayed? 

</p>
           
           
            <p class="para blogHighlightedFont">One silly and seemingly irrelevant factor that can sway voters is simply who is listed first on the ballot box.

</p>
           <h2 class="blogHeader1 para">The “Primacy Effect”
</h2>
               <p class="paraHeader blogBodyFont">In consumer behaviour this “first-is-best” bias is known as a Primacy Effect.  Where everything from products, restaurants, houses, cars, songs, and political candidates that are evaluated first are biasedly preferred over others.  

</p>
           
                          <p class="para blogBodyFont">And when it comes to elections, a variety of research suggests who is listed first on the ballot can account for a 10 percentage point bump.  For a tight election, this can be the difference between life and death for some.  A 50 foot Mexican wall and free tuition for others.


</p>
                         <p class="para blogBodyFont">A variety of reasons are given for why this effect occurs, but when it comes down to it, it can be summed up as cognitive laziness.  



</p>
           
              <p class="para blogHighlightedFont">We are all lazy bags of dirt.

</p>
           
           <p class="para blogBodyFont">How laziness rears its sweet little comfy head when making decisions is simple.  When making decisions you likely start with the first option, think about it, examine it, evaluate it, and then move onto the next option.  But as you work through the options your mind gets tired, you get bored, you get lazy, and you don't pay as much attention to later items than you did to the first.  This happens unconsciously, but it still happens. 


</p>
           
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">When you are done evaluating all options, the increased attention you put towards the first option is more easily remembered.  This increased memory is confused in the brain as increased liking.  And then whala! You choose the first option, thinking it is the best option, but really you just paid it the most attention before you got to bored and wanted to go home to watch The View.
</p>
           <h2 class="blogHeader1 para">The “Primacy Effect”
</h2>
           <p class="paraHeader blogBodyFont">This same effect has been demonstrated on choices for everything from American Idol voting to Presidential voting – Olympic judging to music preferences – Beer choice to Wine choice.
</p>
           
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">For example, along with my colleagues Antonia Mantonakis (Brock University) and Reid Hastie (University of Chicago) we demonstrated that when giving people five samples of wine, the first sample has a 50% chance of being chosen as the favourite.   The trick was that the five samples were identical! It was the same wine, poured from the same bottle, unknowingly to the person sampling.  If people were truly choosing based on their taste preferences, each wine would of have a 20% chance of being chosen.  But this is not the case, Primacy Effect prevails!  Even in this tightly controlled experiment.  Not even Sommeliers and Winery Owners were immune to the order in which the samples were sampled. 

</p>
           
                 <p class="para blogHighlightedFont">People are motivated to conserve their cognitive resources – and voting takes effort.

</p>
           
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">At the end of the day, people are motivated to conserve cognitive resources.  And thinking about things – especially important things like who to vote for – only takes up those resources.  Think of your brain as a muscle.  The more you work and flex that muscle, it is going to get tired, and possibly not do what you want it to do.  So you go with what is easy.
</p>
           <h2 class="blogHeader1 para">What this all means on Election Day
</h2>
            <p class="paraHeader blogBodyFont">When it comes to the undecided voter, they have not taken the time to sit down and weigh the pros and cons, they have been conserving their cognitive resources.
</p>
           
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">Now when confronted with the voting choice in the ballot box (if they even show up), they run down the list, pay the most attention to the first listed on the ballot, but this attention starts to deplete as they continue down the ballot.  Looking back on the options, Trump or Hillary? Trudeau, Harper, Mulcair, or May? Some people – especially those who are undecided – unconsciously interpret that increased attention paid to the first candidate as increased liking.  And Boom!  Four years because you couldn't stay focused for 4 seconds.
</p>
          
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">While this does not mean everyone will vote for the first person on the ballot, it just means that some will be biased in this way.   To help realize the possibility of this occurring, you can think of all eligible voters as being on a scale from “I’m staying at home to diddle myself” to “I took the time to be 100% informed.”  The voters who were are on the cusp of staying home, but instead decided to put on pants and vote are likely those who will experience more boredom when voting.  
</p>
          
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">Across millions of voters, this can mean a lot of people voting for one candidate over another simply because they are listed first on the ballot box.

</p>
             <h2 class="blogHeader1 para">Fixing this could be easy, but it won’t be
</h2>
            <p class="paraHeader blogBodyFont">So what can you do about this?  Well if you want a fair election and cancel out these effects, every single ballot has to be randomized.  Not randomized across states, or provinces, or jurisdictions.  I mean that the ballot the person voting in front of me sees is in a different randomized order than the one I will see. 
</p>
          
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">Sounds like an easy fix, but governments do not have a track record of making evidence based policy decisions.  For example, every State in the US decides the order differently.  Some do a random draw to determine the order, other states like Wisconsin put the previous winners party candidate at the top.  For example, Obama won in 2014, therefore Hilary will be first on the ballot.  Either way, you are still giving one candidate an advantage, whether it was randomly determined or not. 

</p>
          
            <p class="para blogHighlightedFont">You might think Canada is better, because of obvious reasons.  But we are possibly worse! 
</p>
          
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">In Canada, candidates are listed in alphabetical order.  But for an added source of confusion, we don't vote for who we want to be the Prime Minister specifically, we vote for party representatives of our district.  Therefore, the names listed on the ballot box are different across each voting district.  This means that if you want the Primacy Effect boost in Canada, as the party leader you need to simply appoint only party representatives with last names starting with “A.”  Doing this will ensure your parties representatives are listed first on the ballot across the country. 

</p>
          
            <p class="para blogBodyFont">Evil? Yes.  But not as malicious as robo-calls and setting up phoney polling stations.
